# hello-world
My first repository!

Hello. My name is Robert Vasquez. I am a physics/math major. Although computer science isn't my
major or minor, I am curious about machine learning and quantum computer. This class, and the
subsequent coding and computer classes I plan to take, will be great stepping stones to learn
some of those more abstract and advanced computer concepts and branches in computer science.
